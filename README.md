# Real Estate Manager Pro Advanced Search Form Position
---

I have a real estate website project with my client and I want the search form to be on top on both
The content and the sidebar. The best way to position it is at the genesis_before_content (I'm using Genesis Framework by the way).

I've used this [Real Estate Manager Pro](https://codecanyon.net/item/real-estate-manager-pro/20482813?_ga=2.179874148.1907125454.1604643690-2072200941.1604127200) by [WebCodingPlace](https://webcodingplace.com/)
which has an excellent real estate functions and 5 star support.

Since most of their echo is shortcode base and I want it to place outside the content area, I did the shortcode on the functions.php.
The basic function of that code is: To echo out the search form above the content area but exclude the pages not necessary; e.g. Contact Us, Privacy Policy, etc.
I appreciate criticisms and better suggestions to the code I did. Cheers!

PS. The function goes to your functions.php.
